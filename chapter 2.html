    <h2>Biological Anthropology</h2>
    <p>Biological anthropology (also called physical anthropology), then, is an interesting
        mixture of social studies and biological studies; several other ingredients make it
         even more fascinating. The two primary concept areas that tend to hold biological anthropology
          together are human evolution and human biosocial variation; there are many topics that can be
           studied within these two concept areas.

        In order to grasp how humans evolved from earlier life forms, we can look at our closest relatives,
         the primates. Primates include us (Homo sapiens), the apes, the monkeys, and prosimians, such as the
          lemur. We can learn about primate behavior by studying them in the wild, as Jane Goodall did with
           chimpanzees in Africa, or by studying them in small captive colonies. These studies by primatologists
            are particularly important now because many primates are endangered animals, and our knowledge
             of their behavior and environment may help them and us to survive in the future.
        
        We can use the techniques of archaeology to uncover the skeletal remains of our ancestors from the distant 
        past. The exciting findings of human paleontology (the study of fossils) have pushed back our ancestry as
         tool-using humans who walked on two legs to several million years ago. As Louis Leakey showed us, our
          early human ancestors probably hunted and foraged for food on the continent of Africa long befre North
           and South America or Australia were inhabited by people.
