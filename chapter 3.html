    <h2>Cultural Anthropology</h2>
  </div>
    <p>Cultural anthropology is a branch of anthropology foused on the study of cultural <br>
         variation among humans. It is in contrast to social anthropology, which <br>
          cultural variation as a subset of a posited anthropological constant. The umbrella <br>
           term sociocultural anthropology includes both cultural and social anthropology traditions.[1] <br>
        Edward Burnett Tylor <br>
        Anthropologists have pointed out that through culture people can adapt to their environment <br>
         in non-genetic ways, so people living in different environments will often have different cultures. <br>
          Much of anthropological theory has originated in an appreciation of and interest in the tension <br>
           between the local (particular cultures) and the global (a universal human nature, or the web of <br>
           connections between people in distinct places/circumstances).[2] <br>
        
        Cultural anthropology has a rich methodology, including participant observation <br>
         (often called fieldwork because it requires the anthropologist spending an extended <br>
          period of time at the research location), interviews, and surveys.[3] <br>
